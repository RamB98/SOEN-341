<h2>Description of the Project</h2><br/>
</head>
This project consists in building a question and answer website, similar to stack overflow and reddit, where users can ask questions, answer questions as well as upvote on which answer they think is best. We will divide this project into 4 building processes called sprints. Sprint 1 will consist in setting up the running environment. Our running environment, in other words, the language and techcnologies we will use are described later in this readme file, under language and technologies. In sprint 2, we will implement core features. These core feature will also be explained later in this readme file. In sprint 3 we will implement more features as well as receive feedback from our TA to improve our website. Lastly, sprint 4 we will fix bugs, thoroughly test our website and wrap up our final product.

<h2>Objective</h2> <br/>
The objective of this project is to develop a website similar to the Q&A site StackOverflow.  We will build a website with three core features as well as a fourth feature that we will mention later on. Furthermore, another objective will be to understand the value of sprints and teamwork as well as to further our knowledge of software processes.

<h2>Core Features with User Stories</h2><br/>
-Asking and answering questions<br/>
As a forum user, I want to be able to post a question and receive helpful responses, as well as provide other users with helpful responses to their own questions.<br/>
-Voting on answers<br/>
As a web user, I want to be able to vote on answers to contribute to popular and prominent responses to forum questions.<br/>
-Accepting the best answer<br/>
As a academics user, I want to be able to see reliable responses to a question without having to look at all of them.<br/>
-Special feature: Having user profiles <br/>
As a forum user, I want to be able to identify myself and other users with credentials, allowing me and others to save our preferences and share our opinions.<br/>
